# WijmoReact
Wijmo 5 components for React (grid, chart, gauge, inputs)..

[React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) is facebook's library for
building user interfaces in JavaScript. React is unique and incredibly popular,
so we won't spend any time discussing it here. If you are interested in 
a quick introduction to React and a comparison between it and other frameworks/libraries,
here's a [great article on that topic](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/angular-2-versus-react-there-will-be-blood-66595faafd51#.sh9r69w1d).

This [sample](http://bernardo-castilho.github.io/WijmoReact/default.htm)
shows how you can easily encapsulate Wijmo controls into React components.
It has a main component that contains some random data, and several Wijmo-based 
components bound to the same data. If you use any control to modify the data, the
changes are automatically reflected on all other controls on the page.

The **wijmo.react.js** file contains all the Wijmo-React component definitions.
